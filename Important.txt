// Fist planning about our AhaarSetu (food app)
// Whatever we build in website every thing is a component 
// Try building each component and then use the compoenent composition and in the root level div 
/*
  Header component
    -Logo
    -navbar-items

Body component
    -search 
    Restraunt-card-container-component
       -img
       -name   rating
       -Delivery

Footer component
    -links
    -copyright
    
*/


// Always keep in mind when there is reusable code of building something wrap in the component
// For dynamic generation of component we use props,think of like a argument to the js function which is component
// Props are then combined in a object and pass to the component



When there is more than one thing to be export then use the second method
Two types of export
     1.export default name
     2.export const name
Two types of import 
    1.import name from path
    2.import{name} from path   


   // Now there is one hook called useEffect which will help in dynamic ui rendering
   // Which means our website first renders the hardcoded data or skeleton and then we make api calls
   // then after api has responded then re-renders the ui so in this case we use dynamic rendering
   // useEffect will take two arguments first is callback and other is reference
   // the callback will call when the component firts renders it after that it will call the callback
